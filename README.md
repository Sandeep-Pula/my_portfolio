Hello connections,

This is the source code for my portfolio. As I was exploring how to use react with angular project, I thought I can create a portfolio for myself which I have been thinking about.

About, Porjects, Contact pages are inspired from a youtube video. https://youtu.be/FkowOdMjvYo?si=Wjshj1cOXZ0yGvVM 

Based on my learning I implemented the home page by my own. 

Please feel free to use the skeleton of the UI/UX but let me tell you that the **current projects aren't open sourced yet**, which means **the ideas are intellectually personal.**
